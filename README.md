# Story-Visualizer
According to Harvard University researchers, 95 percent of the population tends to retain visual information compared to textual information. Most people prefer visual aids to learn, which could be the main reason why is video better than text. Our primary goal through this project is to generate a sequence of images that pictorially depicts the narration of the story maintaining global consistency of the characters and backgrounds in the plot. This is an application of text-to-image conversion applying generative modeling with support for sequential flow.

Our model requires understanding both Natural Language Processing and contextual reasoning from the images, to implement this we plan to build an encoder-discriminator network. The dataset we are planning to use Pororo, CLEVR and VIST dataset which consists of images and its descriptions.
